Large Language Models (LLMs) are crucial in various applications where real-time or near-real-time processing is essential. Here are some reasons why low-latency LLMs are important:\n","\n","1. **Interactive Systems**: In interactive systems like chatbots, virtual assistants, and conversational AI, low-latency LLMs enable rapid response times, ensuring a seamless user experience. Delayed responses can lead to user frustration and abandonment.\n","2. **Real-time Decision Making**: In applications like autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, or financial trading, low-latency LLMs can quickly process and analyze vast amounts of data to make timely decisions, which can be critical in life-or-death situations or high-stakes environments.\n","3. **Live Streaming and Broadcasting**: Low-latency LLMs are essential for real-time language translation, subtitling, and closed captions in live streaming and broadcasting. This enables global audiences to engage with content in their native languages, enhancing accessibility and inclusivity.\n","4. **Gaming and Esports**: In online gaming and esports, low-latency LLMs can improve player experience by enabling faster communication, more accurate language understanding, and real-time feedback. This can be a competitive advantage in fast-paced, high-stakes games.\n","5. **Healthcare and Telemedicine**: Low-latency LLMs can facilitate timely and accurate language translation, enabling healthcare professionals to communicate effectively with patients who speak different languages. This is particularly important in emergency situations or remote consultations.\n","6. **Customer Service and Support**: In customer-facing applications, low-latency LLMs can help provide rapid and accurate responses to customer inquiries, improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n","7. **Edge AI and IoT**: As Edge AI and IoT devices become more prevalent, low-latency LLMs can process and analyze data in real-time, enabling faster decision-making and more efficient processing at the edge of the network.\n","8. **Security and Surveillance**: Low-latency LLMs can quickly analyze and respond to security threats, such as detecting and alerting authorities to potential cyber attacks or identifying suspicious activity in surveillance footage.\n","9. **Accessibility and Inclusion**: Low-latency LLMs can enable real-time language translation, transcription, and captioning, making content more accessible to people with disabilities, language barriers, or literacy challenges.\n","10. **Competitive Advantage**: In many industries, low-latency LLMs can provide a competitive advantage by enabling faster, more accurate, and more efficient processing of language-based data, leading to improved customer experiences, increased productivity, and better decision-making.\n","\n","In summary, low-latency LLMs are essential in applications where timely processing and analysis of language-based data are critical.

provides all the components needed to perform **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, a technique that augments language model responses with relevant context from external data sources. Here’s a breakdown of key components and how they work together in LlamaIndex:\n","\n","1. **Readers**  \n","Readers are modules that connect LlamaIndex to various data sources. They are responsible for reading documents from these sources, whether they're databases, websites, local files, or APIs. Readers format the data into structures that LlamaIndex can process.\n","\n","2. **Documents**\n","Documents are the raw data chunks or text that the Reader ingests from sources. A document can be a single entity, like a page of text, an article, or any block of information that you want to be available to the model. Documents are divided into **nodes** for easier processing.\n","\n","3. **Nodes**\n","Nodes are smaller units of information within documents. By breaking down documents into nodes, LlamaIndex can handle large datasets more effectively, processing information at a manageable granularity. Each node might represent a paragraph, a sentence, or a specific section. Nodes enable finer control over which parts of the document are retrieved based on the query.\n","\n","4. **Vector Index**\n","The vector index is where LlamaIndex stores nodes in a way that enables fast, relevant retrieval. Each node is transformed into a **vector**—a numerical representation of the content, using embeddings from a language model. The vector index then organizes these embeddings for similarity search, so the system can efficiently retrieve nodes most relevant to a given query.\n","\n","5. **Retrieval**\n","Retrieval is the process of searching the vector index for nodes that are most relevant to a user’s query. The retrieval process identifies nodes with vectors that closely match the query's vector representation. This enables LlamaIndex to pull out specific, relevant information from potentially large datasets, narrowing down the data needed to answer the query.\n","\n","6. **Response Synthesis**\n","Once relevant nodes are retrieved, response synthesis involves combining this information with the language model to generate a coherent, contextually informed response. LlamaIndex processes the retrieved nodes and feeds them to the language model, which uses the information to construct an answer that directly addresses the query.\n","____________\n","#### **Putting It All Together**\n","\n","In the context of **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**, LlamaIndex works as follows:\n","- A **Reader** collects information from various data sources and structures it into **Documents**.\n","- The Documents are broken into **Nodes** for easy processing, which are then embedded and stored in the **Vector Index**.\n","- When a query is made, LlamaIndex performs **Retrieval** to find nodes with content relevant to the query.\n","- Finally, **Response Synthesis** uses these retrieved nodes to generate a response, blending the model’s generative power with the specific information from the dataset.\n","\n","ref: [Building RAG from Scratch](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/low_level/oss_ingestion_retrieval/)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_CsA7YyWA1ze"},"source":["#### Load data from pdf\n","We use file PDFReader to read the text from a pdf file.\n","\n","You can check out other readers [here](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/api_reference/readers/).\n","\n","Some useful readers are web, github, youtube, google docs."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"metadata":{"id":"2lIynKzAgDui","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733635874869,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":46010,"user":{"displayName":"S Yeshwanth","userId":"01697830625041192506"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["from llama_index.readers.file import PDFReader\n","\n","pdf_url = \"/content/2024 Manipal Prospectus.pdf\"\n","# pdf_url = \"/content/note1.pdf\"\n","pdf_reader_obj = PDFReader(return_full_document=True)\n","documents = pdf_reader_obj.load_data(pdf_url)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":17,"status":"ok","timestamp":1733635874870,"user":{"displayName":"S Yeshwanth","userId":"01697830625041192506"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"qmibIwQv9iSc","outputId":"eefca8b5-4243-4079-e3a8-8a79e4ccf78e"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["len(documents) = 1\n","\n","{'file_name': '2024 Manipal Prospectus.pdf'}\n"]}],"source":["print(f\"{len(documents) = }\\n\")\n","for doc in documents[:3]:\n","  print(doc.metadata)"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["len(documents)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"vcEJHBsBsUuM","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733635874870,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":15,"user":{"displayName":"S Yeshwanth","userId":"01697830625041192506"}},"outputId":"7d8f7d1c-106c-4ab1-cc31-75f70c25a647"},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["1"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["type(documents[0])"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":176},"id":"tyINPjUYyNH_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733636463392,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":429,"user":{"displayName":"S Yeshwanth","userId":"01697830625041192506"}},"outputId":"30b9b4c2-58c4-49b8-bfc9-4bb758ea0c44"},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["llama_index.core.schema.Document"],"text/html":["<div style=\"max-width:800px;
