- In-semester Assessment is considered as the Internal Assessment (IA) in each subject for 50 marks, which includes the performances in class / tutorial participation, assignment work, lab work, class tests, mid-term tests, quizzes etc.
- End-semester examination (ESE) for each lab subject is conducted for a maximum of 50.
- End-semester mark for a maximum of 50 and IA marks for a maximum of 50 are added for a maximum of 100 marks to decide upon the grade in a subject.
