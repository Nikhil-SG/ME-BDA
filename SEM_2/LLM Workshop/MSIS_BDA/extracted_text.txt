# Program Education Objectives (PEOs)

The overall objectives of the Learning Outcomes-based Curriculum Framework (LOCF) for **ME (Big Data Analytics)**, program are as follows.

| PEO No. | Education Objective |
| --- | --- |
| PEO 1 | Develop in depth understanding of the key technologies in data engineering, data science and business analytics. |
| PEO 2 | Practice problem analysis and decision-making using machine learning techniques. |
| PEO 3 | Gain practical, hands-on experience with statistics, programming languages and big data tools through coursework and applied |
|  | research experiences. |

# Program Outcomes (POs)

By the end of the postgraduate program in Big Data Analytics, graduates will be able to:

| PO1 | Independently carry out research /investigation and development work to solve practical problems. |
| --- | --- |
| PO2 | Write and present a substantial technical report/document. |
| PO3 | Demonstrate a degree of mastery over the area as per the specialization of the program. The mastery should be at a level |
|  | higher than the requirements in the appropriate bachelor program. |

Note:

- In-semester Assessment is considered as the Internal Assessment (IA) in this course for 50 marks, which includes the performances in class participation, assignment work, class tests, mid-term tests, quizzes etc.
- End-semester examination (ESE) for this course is conducted for a maximum of 100 and the same will be scaled down to 50.

End-semester marks for a maximum of 50 and IA marks for a maximum of 50 are added for a maximum of 100 marks to decide upon the grade in this course.
