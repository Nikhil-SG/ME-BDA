Note:

- In-semester Assessment is considered as the Internal Assessment (IA) in this course for 50 marks, which includes the performances in class participation, assignment work, class tests, mid-term tests, quizzes etc.
- End-semester examination (ESE) for this course is conducted for a maximum of 100 and the same will be scaled down to 50.
- End-semester marks for a maximum of 50 and IA marks for a maximum of 50 are added for a maximum of 100 marks to decide upon the grade in this course.

Weightage for CO1 = (mid semester marks for CO1 / 1.6666 + Assignment marks for CO1/1.0 + ESE marks for CO1 / 2)/100
