Note:

- In-semester Assessment is considered as the Internal Assessment (IA) in this course for 50 marks, which includes the performances in class participation, assignment work, class tests, mid-term tests, quizzes etc.
- End-semester examination (ESE) for this course is conducted for a maximum of 100 and the same will be scaled down to 50.
- End-semester marks for a maximum of 50 and IA marks for a maximum of 50 are added for a maximum of 100 marks to decide upon the grade in this course.

Weightage for CO1 = (IT1 marks for CO1 / 2.5 + IT2 marks for CO1 / 2.5 + Assignment marks for CO1 + ESE marks for CO1 / 2)/100 = (25/2.5 + 0 + 0 + 20/ 2)/100 = 0.2

| 1 | Internal Test | 0.4 | 2  | Each internal test is assessed for a maximum of 50 marks and scaled down to 40 |
|  |  |  |  | marks. |
| 2 | Assignments | 0.1 |  1 | Performance is measured using assignments/quiz attainment level. |
|  |  |  |  | Assignments/quiz are evaluated for a maximum of 10 marks. |
|  |  |  |  | Performance is measured using ESE attainment level. |
| 3 | ESE | 0.5 | 1  | Reference: question paper and answer scheme. |
|  |  |  |  | ESE is assessed for a maximum of 100 marks and scaled down to 50 marks. |
