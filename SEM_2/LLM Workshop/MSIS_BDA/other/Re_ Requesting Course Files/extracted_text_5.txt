- In-semester Assessment is considered as the Internal Assessment (IA) in this course for 50 marks, which includes the performances in lab participation, assignment work, lab work, lab tests, quizzes etc.
- End-semester examination (ESE) for this course is conducted for a maximum of 50.
- End-semester marks for a maximum of 50 and IA marks for a maximum of 50 are added for a maximum of 100 marks to decide upon the grade in this course.

Weightage for CO1 = (Lab Test marks for CO1 + Assignment marks for CO1 + ESE marks for CO1) /100

= (5 + 2 +5)/100 = 0.12
