Note:

- In-semester Assessment is considered as the Mid-Term Assessment (MA) in this course for 50 marks, which includes the performances in class participation, assignment work, class tests, mid-term tests, quizzes etc.
- End-semester examination (ESE) for this course is conducted for a maximum of 100 and the same will be scaled down to 50.
- End-semester marks for a maximum of 50 and IA marks for a maximum of 50 are added for a maximum of 100 marks to decide upon the grade in this course.

Weightage for CO1 = (IT1 marks for CO1 / 2.5 + IT2 marks for CO1 / 2.5 + Assignment marks for CO1 + ESE marks for CO1 / 2)/100

(25/2.5 + 0 + 0 + 20/ 2)/100 = 0.2

### 1.9 Assessment Details

|  |  |  | • | Mid-Term is assessed for a |
|  |  |  |  | maximum of 50 marks and scaled |
|  |  |  |  | down to 30 marks. |
|  |  |  | • | Performance is measured using |
| 2 | Assignments | 0.2 | 2 | assignments/quiz attainment level. |
|  |  |  | • | Assignments/quiz are evaluated for |
|  |  |  |  | a maximum of 20 marks. |
