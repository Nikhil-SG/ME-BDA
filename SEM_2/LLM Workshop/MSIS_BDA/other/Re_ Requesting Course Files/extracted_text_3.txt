Note:

- In-semester Assessment is considered as Midterm Assessment (IA) in this course for 50 marks which includes the performances in class participation, assignment work, mid-term tests, quizzes etc.
- End-semester examination (ESE) for this course is conducted for a maximum of 100 and the same will be scaled down to 50.
- End-semester marks for a maximum of 50 and IA marks for a maximum of 50 are added for a maximum of 100 marks to decide upon the grade in this course.

Weightage for CO1 = (IT1 marks for CO1 / 2.5 + IT2 marks for CO1 / 2.5 + Assignment marks for CO1 + ESE marks for CO1 / 2)/100 = (25/2.5 + 0 + 0 + 20/ 2)/100 = 0.2

#### 1.9 Assessment Details

The assessment tools to be used for the Current Academic Year (CAY) are as follows:

| SI. | Tools | Weightage | Frequency | Details of Measurement (Weightage/Rubrics/Duration, etc.) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No. |  |  |  |  |
| 1 | Internal Test | 0.3 | 1 | • Performance is measured using internal test attainment level. • Reference: question paper and answer scheme. |
|  |  |  |  | • Each internal test is assessed for a maximum of 50 marks and scaled down to 30 |
|  |  |  |  | marks. |
| 2 | Assignments | 0.2 | 2 | • Performance is measured using assignments/quiz attainment level. |
|  |  |  |  | • Assignments/quiz are evaluated for a maximum of 20 marks. |
|  |  |  |  | • Performance is measured using ESE attainment level. |
| 3 | ESE | 0.5 | 1 | • Reference: question paper and answer scheme. |
|  |  |  |  | • ESE is assessed for a maximum of 100 marks and scaled down to 50 marks. |
