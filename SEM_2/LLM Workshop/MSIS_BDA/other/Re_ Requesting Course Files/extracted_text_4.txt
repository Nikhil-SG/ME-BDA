| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CO No. | CO Name | Mid semester | Assignment | End Semester | CO wise |
|  |  | (Max. 50) | (Max. 20) | (Max. 100) | Weightage |
| CO1 | Analyze the object-oriented programming concepts | 10 | 8 | 10 | 0.11 |
| CO2 | Examine the various core java concepts | 30 | 5 | 40 | 0.44 |
| CO3 | Appraise the various techniques used to develop a user interface (UI) application |  | 2 | 20 | 0.16 |

|  | Marks (weightage) | 0.3 | 0.2 | 0.5 | 1.0 |

Note:

- In-semester Assessment is considered as the Internal Assessment (IA) in this course for 50 marks, which includes the performances in class participation, assignment work, class tests, mid-term tests, quizzes etc.
- End-semester examination (ESE) for this course is conducted for a maximum of 100 and the same will be scaled down to 50.

![](_page_13_Picture_0.jpeg)

- End-semester marks for a maximum of 50 and IA marks for a maximum of 50 are added for a maximum of 100 marks to decide upon the grade in this course.
Weightage for CO1 = (mid semester marks for CO1 / 1.6666 + Assignment marks for CO1/1.0 + ESE marks for CO1 / 2)/100

### 1.9 Assessment Details

The assessment tools to be used for the Current Academic Year (CAY) are as follows:

| SI. | Tools | Weightage | Frequency | Details of Measurement (Weightage/Rubrics/Duration, etc.) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No. |  |  |  |  |
| 1 | Internal Test | 0.3 | 1 | • Performance is measured using internal test attainment level. • Reference: question paper and answer scheme. |
|  |  |  |  | • Each internal test is assessed for a maximum of 50 marks and scaled down to 40 |
|  |  |  |  | marks. |
| 2 | Assignments | 0.2 | 2 | • Performance is measured using assignments/quiz attainment level. |
|  |  |  |  | • Assignments/quiz are evaluated for a maximum of 10 marks. |
| 3 | End semester | 0.5 | 1 | • Performance is measured using ESE attainment level. • Reference: question paper and answer scheme. |
|  |  |  |  | • ESE is assessed for a maximum of 100 marks and scaled down to 50 marks. |
