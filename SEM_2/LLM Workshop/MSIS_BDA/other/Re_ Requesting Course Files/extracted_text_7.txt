Note:

- In-semester Assessment is considered as the Internal Assessment (IA) in this course for 50 marks, which includes the performances in lab participation, assignment work, lab work, lab tests, quizzes etc.
- End-semester examination (ESE) for this course is conducted for a maximum of 50.
- End-semester marks for a maximum of 50 and IA marks for a maximum of 50 are added for a maximum of 100 marks to decide upon the grade in this course.

Weightage for CO1 = (Lab Test marks for CO1 + Assignment marks for CO1 + ESE marks for CO1) /100

# 1.9 Assessment Details

The assessment tools to be used for the Current Academic Year (CAY) are as follows:
