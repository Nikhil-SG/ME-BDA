### 4.1 Assessment Plan

|  | COs |  | Marks | & weightage |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CO No. | CO Name | Lab Test | Assignment | End Semester | CO wise |
|  |  | (Max. 30) | (Max. 20) | (Max. 50) | Weightage |
| CO1 | Implement the single tasking applications development using ARM microcontroller. | 20 | - | 20 | 0.34 |
| CO2 | Implement microcontroller applications using interface device with ARM microcontrollers. | 10 | - | 20 | 0.14 |
| CO3 | Implement microcontroller applications for Embedded Communication Protocols. | - | 20 | 10 | 0.24 |
|  | Marks (weightage) | 0.3 | 0.2 | 0.5 | 1 |

Note:

- In-semester Assessment is considered as the Internal Assessment (IA) in this course for 50 marks, which includes the performances in lab participation, assignment work, lab work, lab tests, quizzes etc.
- End-semester examination (ESE) for this course is conducted for a maximum of 50.
- End-semester marks for a maximum of 50 and IA marks for a maximum of 50 are added for a maximum of 100 marks to decide upon the grade in this course.

Weightage for CO1 = (Lab Test marks for CO1 + Assignment marks for CO1 + ESE marks for CO1) /100

= (5 + 2 +5)/100 = 0.12
