Note:

- In-semester Assessment is considered as the Internal Assessment (IA) in this course for 50 marks, which includes the performances in class participation, assignment work, class tests, mid-term tests, quizzes etc.
- End-semester examination (ESE) for this course is conducted for a maximum of 100 and the same will be scaled down to 50.
- End-semester marks for a maximum of 50 and IA marks for a maximum of 50 are added for a maximum of 100 marks to decide upon the grade in this course.

Weightage for CO1 = (IT1 marks for CO1 / 2.5 + IT2 marks for CO1 / 2.5 + Assignment marks for CO1 + ESE marks for CO1 / 2)/100

= (25/2.5 + 0 + 0 + 20/ 2)/100 = 0.2

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No. |  |  |  | (Weightage/Rubrics/Duration, etc.) |
|  |  |  |  | • Performance is measured using internal test attainment level. |
|  |  |  |  | • Reference: question paper and |
| 1 | Internal Test | 0.4 | 2 | answer scheme. |
|  |  |  |  | • Each internal test is assessed for a |
|  |  |  |  | maximum of 50 marks and scaled |
|  |  |  |  | down to 40 marks. |
|  |  |  |  | • Performance is measured using |
| 2 | Assignments | 0.1 | 1 | assignments/quiz attainment level. |
|  |  |  |  | • Assignments/quiz are evaluated for |
|  |  |  |  | a maximum of 10 marks. |
|  |  |  |  | • Performance is measured using |
|  |  |  |  | ESE attainment level. |
